* Documentation
  Redo tutorial?
  Using helpers
    haml_concat and haml_tag in particular
  Syntax highlighting?

* Code
  Keep track of error offsets everywhere
    Use this to show error location in messages
    Just clean up SassScript syntax errors in general
    Lexer errors in particular are icky
    See in particular error changes made in c07b5c8
** Haml
   Support finer-grained HTML-escaping in filters
   Speed
     Make tags with dynamic attributes pre-render as much as possible
     Including the attribute name where doable
   :ugly + :html improvements
     Ignore closing tags where we can
       http://code.google.com/speed/articles/optimizing-html.html
       Requires Haml parsing refactor
     Don't quote attributes that don't require it
       http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2
       http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#attributes
** Sass
   Benchmark the effects of storing the raw template in sassc
     If it's expensive, overload RootNode dumping/loading to dup and set @template to nil
     Then fall back on reading from actual file
   Make Rack middleware the default for Rails and Merb versions that support it
   CSS superset
   Classes are mixins
     Can refer to specific property values? Syntax?
   Pull in Compass watcher stuff
   Internationalization
     Particularly word constituents in Regexps
   Optimization
     http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/
     http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/
     Also comma-folding identical rules where possible
     Multiple levels
       0: No optimization
       1: Nothing that changes doc structure
         No comma-folding
       2: Anything that keeps functionality identical to O2 (default)
       3: Assume order of rules doesn't matter
       Comma-fold even if there are intervening rules that might interfere
   CSS3
     Add (optional) support for http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#calc
       Cross-unit arithmetic should compile into this
       Should we use "mod" in Sass for consistency?
